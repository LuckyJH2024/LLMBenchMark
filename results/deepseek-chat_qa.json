Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \"coalition of the willing\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland.

        "prompt": "Question: Plato's theory of forms or \"ideas\" describes ideal forms (for example the platonic solids in geometry or abstracts like Goodness and Justice), as universals existing independently of any particular instance. Arne Gr\u00f8n calls this doctrine \"the classic example of a metaphysical idealism as a transcendent idealism\", while Simone Klein calls Plato \"the earliest representative of metaphysical objective idealism\". Nevertheless, Plato holds that matter is real, though transitory and imperfect, and is perceived by our body and its senses and given existence by the eternal ideas that are perceived directly by our rational soul. Plato was therefore a metaphysical and epistemological dualist, an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid: Plato's thought cannot therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense, although quantum physics' assertion that man's consciousness is an immutable and primary requisite for not merely perceiving but shaping matter, and thus his reality, would give more credence to Plato's dualist position.[citation needed]What sort of dualist is Plato regarded as?\nAnswer:",
        "response": "Plato is regarded as a **metaphysical and epistemological dualist**. His philosophy posits a dualism between the eternal, unchanging realm of Forms (Ideas) and the transient, imperfect world of material particulars. \n\n- **Metaphysically**, he distinguishes between the ideal, immaterial Forms (which are the true reality) and the physical, sensible world (which is a flawed reflection of the Forms).  \n- **Epistemologically**, he contrasts rational knowledge (grasped by the soul through reason) with sensory perception (which provides only opinion or belief about the material world).  \n\nWhile his theory of Forms aligns with aspects of **objective idealism** (since the Forms are mind-independent universals), his acknowledgment of matter as real\u2014albeit inferior\u2014makes his position distinct from modern idealism, which often denies the independent reality of matter. Thus, Plato's dualism is not purely idealist in the contemporary sense but rather a combination of **transcendent idealism (regarding the Forms) and a qualified realism (regarding matter)**. \n\nQuantum physics' emphasis on the role of consciousness in shaping reality might lend some support to Plato\u2019s dualist perspective, but this remains a debated interpretation rather than a settled philosophical or scientific consensus.",

The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty.

The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d. 68 BC). The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy.

To measure attraction and arousal he proposed that biological measures should be developed and used. There are numerous biological/physiological measures that exist that can measure sexual orientation such as sexual arousal, brain scans, eye tracking, body odour preference, and anatomical variations such as digit-length ratio and right or left handedness.
