| Context: If it rains, the ground gets wet. The ground is wet.                        | No, it did not necessarily rain. The statement "If it rains, the ground gets wet" implies a possibility or condition, but does not guarantee that it actually rained. We only know that the ground is wet, but we can't conclude for certain whether it was raining or not. There could be other explanations for why the ground is wet (e.g. flooding, sprinklers, etc.). |         0.8061 |        0.3697 |              0.5355 |  0.8061 |

We only know that the ground is wet, but we can't conclude for certain whether it was raining or not. There could be other explanations for why the ground is wet (e.g. flooding, sprinklers, etc.). |         0.8061 |        0.3697 |              0.5355 |  0.8061 |

|                                                                                      | 3. **Choose a theme (optional)**: If you want to add an extra layer of excitement, pick a theme for the party that aligns with the guest of honor's interests or favorite colors.                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |               |                     |         |
|                                                                                      | 4. **Pick a date and time**: Schedule the party when the guest of honor is least expecting it. Make sure they have no other plans during that time frame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                |               |                     |         |

This might involve creating a fake plan or convincing them to come for another reason (e.g., "Let's grab coffee").                                                                                                                       |                |               |                     |         |

You can use online invitation platforms or create your own designs.                                                                                                                                                          |                |               |                     |         |

Use code names, vague descriptions, or misdirection when discussing the party with others.                                                                                                                                                                                   |                |               |                     |         |

When they enter the room, shout "Surprise!" and let the celebration begin!                                                                                                                                                                |                |               |                     |         |

| Context: If it rains, the ground gets wet. The ground is wet.                        | No, it did not necessarily rain. The statement "If it rains, the ground gets wet" implies a possibility or condition, but does not guarantee that it actually rained. We only know that the ground is wet, but we can't conclude for certain whether it was raining or not. There could be other explanations for why the ground is wet (e.g. flooding, sprinklers, etc.). |         0.8061 |        0.3697 |              0.5355 |  0.8061 |
