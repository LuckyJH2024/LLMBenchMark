However, if we're talking about the tallest mountain measured from its base to its peak under water, then Mauna Kea in Hawaii would be taller than Everest due to most of its mass being beneath the ocean surface. But for practical purposes and common reference, Mount Everest is considered the tallest mountain on Earth.",
