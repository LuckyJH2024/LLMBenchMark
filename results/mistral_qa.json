The moral of the story is about the consequences of deception and the importance of trust.\n\n2) \"Sour Grapes\" is based on Aesop's Fable called \"The Fox and the Grapes.\" In this fable, a fox tries to reach some grapes hanging from a vine but cannot. When he can't attain them, he decides they must not be sweet, thus justifying his inability to enjoy them. The moral of the story is about accepting one's limitations and acknowledging that sometimes things are simply out of our reach.\n\nThese fables continue to inspire and teach us valuable life lessons even today!",
