Here is the completed code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_even(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\n\nIn this function, we initialize a variable `total` to store the sum of even numbers. Then we iterate through each number in the list using a for loop. Inside the loop, we check if the current number is divisible by 2 (i.e., if its modulo with 2 is zero). If it is, we add the number to our `total`. Finally, we return the total sum of even numbers.",
