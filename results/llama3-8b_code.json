If the remainder is 0 (`num % 2 == 0`), then the number is even.\n* If the number is even, we add it to the `total` variable.\n* Finally, we return the total sum of all even numbers.\n\nYou can test this function with a sample list of numbers, like this:\n```\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(sum_even(numbers))  # Output: 12 (2 + 4 + 6)\n```",

Then, we compare the original string with its reverse (`text[::-1]`). If they are the same, then the original string is a palindrome.\n\nFor example, if you call `is_palindrome(\"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\")`, it will return `True` because \"amanaplanacanalpanama\" is a palindrome.",

The base case is when `n` is equal to 1, in which case the function returns 1 (since 1! is equal to 1). For all other values of `n`, the function calls itself with the argument `n - 1`, and multiplies the result by `n`. This process continues until `n` reaches 1, at which point the function starts returning and the final result is calculated.",
