        "response": "1. Gather your ingredients: This typically includes flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, eggs, milk, vegetable oil or butter, and vanilla extract. You may also need specific ingredients based on the type of cake you're making (e.g., chocolate cake might require cocoa powder).\n\n2. Preheat your oven: Most cakes bake well at around 350\u00b0F (176\u00b0C), but this can vary depending on the recipe, so always check the instructions.\n\n3. Grease and flour your pan: To prevent the cake from sticking to the pan, apply a thin layer of butter or non-stick spray, then dust with flour. Shake off any excess flour before pouring in the batter.\n\n4. Mix dry ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk to remove any lumps and mix well.\n\n5. Beat wet ingredients: In another bowl, beat the eggs slightly. Then add milk, vegetable oil or melted butter, and vanilla extract. Mix well.\n\n6. Combine wet and dry mixtures: Slowly pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture while gently stirring. Be careful not to overmix as this can lead to a tough cake. A few lumps are okay.\n\n7. Pour batter into pan: Carefully pour the cake batter into the greased and floured pan.\n\n8. Bake the cake: Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for the specified time according to your recipe, usually around 20-30 minutes. Use a toothpick or skewer to check if the cake is done; it should come out clean.\n\n9. Cool the cake: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. After that, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting or serving.\n\n10. Frost or decorate (optional): If you want to add frosting or other decorations to your cake, do so once it has cooled completely. Enjoy your homemade cake!",
